<div class="card-body"><p>Modifying your bathroom layout can be a costly part of a remodel due to the necessary demolition, removal, and disposal of existing fixtures, and any alterations involving drywall cutting will necessitate drywall replacement, contributing to the overall expenses.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Bathroom remodeling is typically one of the most expensive home projects, as it often entails skilled labor, plumbing and electrical work, the use of high-end materials and fixtures, and potential updates to the room&#39;s layout.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In summary, a bathroom remodel will typically cost less than half of what a general contractor (GC) would charge, as it allows you to keep the material costs while saving on labor expenses, but the decision to hire a GC may be justified for the convenience it offers, which can be considered a luxury worth the additional cost.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>During kitchen or bathroom remodeling projects, painting is typically one of the final tasks to be completed, as the removal of various items during these renovations poses a risk to painted surfaces, and any wall damage that occurs can be addressed after the remodeling work is finished.</p>
